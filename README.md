What user stories were completed this iteration?

A developer/student should be able to move a task to a different column in order to change what stage a task is currently at.  
A developer/student should be able to view the timestamps of when a task was created/deleted so they can keep track of a the life cycle of each task.  
A developer/student should be run a script so they can run the program.  


What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

A developer/student should be able to assign a particular user to a task in order to document who is taking ownership for that particular task.  
A developer/student should be able to print the board to visually see which column they are looking at to determine what stage their task is at.  


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

There are certain variables that currently need to be closed (a few memory leaks) that we need to either SuppressWarnings to or fix in a different way


What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

Based on peer feedback we have provided a bash shell script in the repository folder called boardScript.sh. The user should be able to run it with the command ./boardScript.sh and it should pull up the kanban board inside the terminal.
